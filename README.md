# Pursuit-Core-iOS-Local-Notification-Lab

Build a timer app.  Your app should have the following components:

## Set Timer View Controller

- A spinner to select how long the timer should run for
- A text field where a message can be inserted
- A button to launch the timer

After the time has elapsed, it should trigger a local notification.

## Manage Timers View Controller

- Shows a list of all timers that you've set, with the remaining time and message
- Swiping left on a cell deletes the timer and makes it so that the notification won't fire


## Bonus

- Include the option to have an image appear in the local notification, and select that image in the Set Timer View Controller
- Include specialized in-app handling of the timer going off
